# ShadowFoxPython and Java Development
This projects were developed as part of my Python and Java development internship at Shadowfox. During my time at the company, I focused on enhancing my skills in Python and Java development, and this project is a testament to the knowledge and experience I gained. The goal of this project is to efficiently develop robust Python and Java applications and tools that can be used in various real-world scenarios. Through this project, I aimed to apply best practices in software development, collaborate effectively with my team, and contribute meaningful code to our ongoing projects.
